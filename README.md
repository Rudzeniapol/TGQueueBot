Hi! In general, due to recent events, I decided to write a telegram bot to organize queue. Honestly, I'm confused that I need to pull my friend every time and he can be busy sometimes, so I decided to automate it. I tried to make your use experience pleasant, but I accept your suggestions in the bos. In any case, he still needs a lot of testing, to look at his workload and many things, but I think we will need this thing in the future, so we will slowly try to integrate him into our society 351001. In general, I suggest a bot, I hope you will support it, I will do a survey below to find out how you like this idea. I will ask the elders not to come in, as there are no checks on who is signing up. For now, consider this a beta version, since one of the disadvantages of this bot will be that it will only work as long as I have a script running on any device, and there is also an Internet connection (And this queue will not be official yet). I hope for your understanding and warm welcome of this bot. I've already been a little worried, I hope you won't be too critical, since I wrote it myself and last night). Here is the link - https://t.me/labs_queue_poit_bot I am waiting for your reviews, as I really want to make your experience enjoyable!
